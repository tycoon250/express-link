                    I want to recognize and recommend this excellent, medical transport company, express link Medical Transportation Company,  based in Meridian, Idaho.  Recently, my elderly father had been hospitalized in Boise, Idaho.  My father lives over 150 miles away from that hospital.  I live out of state.  Because of the Coronavirus Pandemic, I was unable to travel to Idaho, to care for my father.  Relatively quickly, I needed to locate a safe and dependable, medical transport company to drive my father home.  I found the express link Medical Transportation Company on-line.  express link Representative, Craig, worked diligently with me via text & cell calls, from pre-trip, through mid-trip, and to destination arrival.  As an anxious daughter unable to be at her father’s side, and during a Pandemic, I will always be grateful to Craig for his humanity and kindness  ; and, for working well beyond professional expectations.  Moreover, this company employs a thoroughly analyzed Coronavirus Protocol, designed to ensure their passenger/ patient’s safety, and their drivers.  Bravo, express link!!  Thank you all, for your supreme service.

                    These folks are seriously such blessings. I was facing getting out of the hospital with absolutely no way home. They took the time and love in their hearts to take me home. The beautiful story behind this company is amazing. So many people need the help this company offers and sadly there’s hardly any out there. But Express Link Transportation is out there willing to help any and everyone. If anyone needs medical transport to appointments, to or from the hospital etc they are the best out there. Not only are doing something amazing the people behind it are such generous beautiful loving people. I don’t know what I would have done without them. I recommend them 100%. Thank you for everything. I am so blessed by your generosity!
